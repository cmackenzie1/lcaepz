Lambda Chi Alpha prides itself on being a group of like-minded men committed to bettering one another as leaders, social activists, and conscientious citizens. Our fraternity places the utmost emphasis on loyalty, integrity, personal courage, and our duty to both ourselves and society. Philanthropic efforts are at the forefront of our commitment to our community: food drives, blood drives, community events, and others are a consistent part of being a member of Lambda Chi Alpha – those that feel they owe nothing to their community have no place with us. As active members of the University community, we also host regular social and academic events both on campus and in our Chapter house. Founded in 1945, our Chapter has a proven track record as leaders at this institution, in this community, and our city. For more information, please see the “Let’s Chat” box below. We look forward to hearing from you.

If you’re interested in partnering with Lambda Chi Alpha for a philanthropic, social, or academic event, please contact our President at <a href="mailto:president@epsilonrho.ca">president@epsilonrho.ca</a>

In ZAX,
The Brothers of Lambda Chi Alpha
